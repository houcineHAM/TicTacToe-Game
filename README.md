# TicTacToe-Game
A multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java. It uses server-client communication (Java Sockets) to allow two players to play over a network. The game includes a simple Swing GUI, real-time move synchronization, and handles player disconnections. Improved and updated after a year.
